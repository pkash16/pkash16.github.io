## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I am a 3rd year PhD student at the University of Southern California working at the Magnetic Engineering Research Laboratory [MREL](https://mrel.usc.edu) and the Dynamic Imaging Science Center [DISC](https://disc.usc.edu). My hobbies include music production [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyzl_Z2Or32KIv2Sodcgj4Q) and playing tennis.

## Research Interest

My research interests are in fast, low-latency MRI reconstruction, both with and without data-driven (Machine Learning) methods. I am also very interested in reproducible research, open science, and strive to make all my work and data as public as possible.
